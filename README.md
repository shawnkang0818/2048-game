![Alt text](img/game-img.jpg)  
2048 is played on a simple 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles sliding as the player uses the four arrow keys to move them. When the game starts, there are already two tiles with a value of 2 in the grid, and after each turn, another such tile will appear in a random empty space. The block slides as far as possible in the selected direction until stopped by another block or a grid edge. If two blocks with the same number collide while moving, they will merge into one block whose value is the sum of the two colliding blocks.
